# IncredibowlApp
There are couple of ways to run the project. I included a build so you don't have to build the project to see it in
action. 

You can go to the /dist diretory and run 

`python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8008`

Incredibowl will run on localhost 8008;

If you would like to run the project yourself using the angular CLI
IncredibowlApp directory where the package.js is and run

`npm install`

`npm start` 

This project was generated with [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0-beta.28.3.
my node version was : 7.1.0
my npm version was : 3.10.9
## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
